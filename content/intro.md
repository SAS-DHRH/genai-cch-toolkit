Generative AI raises a host of social and operational questions, concerns and debates. Many of these are mediated through the legal system, by challenging existing legal rules and requiring new laws and policy frameworks.

These debates are evolving rapidly, especially as generative AI, since last summer (2023), has hit the ground runningâ€”so fast that it can feel hard to keep up. Legal experts and policymakers are examining new rules to govern technology, while advocates are suggesting entirely new strategies to address novel problems (or old problems with new prominence).
