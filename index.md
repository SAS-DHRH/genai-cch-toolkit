This is a toolkit for Generative AI, data protection and intellectual property in digital cultural heritage. It has been initially developed by Dr Anna-Maria Sichani, as part of the TaNC-funded The Congruence Engine project.

The following document is structured under **“ℹ️ Points of Information”** and **‘❓Questions’,** in order to make these rather difficult and obscure topics more accessible and easy to follow. The pace of AI development continues and will continue to accelerate, and we expect that terminology, legislation and technology around this area will quickly evolve. This document should therefore be viewed as a **snapshot in time**.

I will try to offer comprehensive and accessible accounts around ‘hot topics’ and provide as much information as possible to back them up. Where possible, I have aimed to also give some context relating to the origins and use of terms and examples or case studies. 

**Please don’t hesitate to add interesting resources or questions you might have! This is a work-in-progress.**
